## Mwangi&Sons Borehole Services User

To create the user side of the Uzima Borehole System, we'll build upon the existing admin side structure, focusing on providing a seamless experience for end-users. The workflow will include user registration, profile management, service requests, tracking service status, payment processing, and viewing service history. Here’s a detailed data workflow for the user side:

### User Side Data Workflow

1. **User Registration and Authentication**
   - **Register**: Users create an account by providing necessary details like name, email, phone number, and password. Verification through email or phone may be implemented.
   - **Login**: Users log in using their credentials.
   - **Forgot Password**: Users can reset their password via email.

2. **Profile Management**
   - **View Profile**: Users can view their profile details.
   - **Edit Profile**: Users can update their personal information.

3. **Service Requests**
   - **Request Service**: Users can request borehole drilling services by filling out a form with details such as location, desired depth, and any additional requirements.
   - **View Services**: Users can view a list of available services and their descriptions.

4. **Service Tracking**
   - **Track Service Status**: Users can track the status of their service requests (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed).

5. **Payment Processing**
   - **View Charges**: Users can view the calculated charges for their requested services.
   - **Make Payment**: Users can make payments online through various payment methods (e.g., credit card, mobile money).
